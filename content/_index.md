I'm a PhD student at the University of St Andrews in [SACHI](https://sachi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/), supervised by [Alice Toniolo](https://at258.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and [Miguel Nacenta](http://nacenta.com).

### Building tools to improve forecasting

I'm interested in the potential of software tools to improve judgemental forecasting accuracy and group deliberation.

Often when we are making decisions, it's based on what we expect their consequences to be. So if we can improve our ability to predict future events, we can make better decisions.

I'm exploring the idea that developing tools to improve forecasting may be an especially scalable way to improve institutional decision-making.

#### Transformations between representations

To support this wider project, I'm interested in how representations (like diagrams and visualisations) can affect the way we think, and what kinds of structures we discover.

Lots of great work has been done on the content of representations. But I think it's also worth looking at how we *transform*, or move between, representations. This is my current research focus.

I made [Write Reason](https://adambinks.me/write-reason/editor), a tool to study transformations. It combines a text editor and a mapping interface.

## Outside the lab

I co-founded [One for the World: St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/OneForTheWorldStAndrews). It's a community where we pledge to give a portion of our future income to *highly effective* charities, based on research from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/).

I'm also fascinated by the wider project of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/), which asks: what are the world's most pressing problems, and how can we do *as much as we can* to solve them? The [St Andrews group](https://www.facebook.com/EASaintAndrews) is one of my favourite communities.
