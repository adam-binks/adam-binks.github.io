I'm a PhD student at the University of St Andrews in [SACHI](https://sachi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/), supervised by [Alice Toniolo](https://at258.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and [Miguel Nacenta](nacenta.com).

### Improving group deliberation

I'm interested in the potential of software tools to reduce the effects of cognitive biases in group deliberation.

If we can build tools to do this, then — unlike time-consuming training — that's a really scalable solution, that could help incrementally improve institutional decision-making.

#### Transformations between representations

To support this wider project, I'm interested in how representations (like diagrams and visualisations) can affect the way we think, and what kinds of discoveries we can make.

Lots of great work has been done on the content of representations. But I think it's also worth looking at how we *transform*, or move between, representations. This is my current research focus.

I made [Write Reason](https://ab390.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/), a tool to study transformations. It combines a text editor and a mapping interface.

## Outside the lab

I co-founded [One for the World: St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/OneForTheWorldStAndrews). It's a community where we pledge to give a portion of our future income to *highly effective* charities, based on research from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/).

I'm also fascinated by the wider project of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/), which asks: what are the world's most pressing problems, and how can we do *as much as we can* to solve them? The [St Andrews group](https://www.facebook.com/EASaintAndrews) is one of my favourite communities.
